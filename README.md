# Ui-Test
This UI project was a take-home challenge to create a webpage with a mobile-first approach. 

## Technology Stack
To build this project, I used SASS as a pre-processor, and BEM Methodology organises the classes used. 
I also took advantage of Flexbox and Grid to better achieve the precision of the UI.
